# project3
The code is data analysing with real data set of acssidents in usa between 2016 and 2020
At first we use google colab becuase we have very big dta set and we use libraries like cudf cuml numpy matplotlib and seaborn to analyse the data we have
After giving the code the link of our data set to download it and we say that we have the kaggle key we start cleaning it by finding useless informations
Also we turn every boolean type to uint8 for better and softer work and easier job
We find  range of numbers to have the best option og type for it so it uses less memory
After cleaning data we use all of data and plot a chart and number of acssidents by their severity
There is one part of code where we simply use statistics and find the oulier datas and we have all of them as a new and clean dataframe so we could use them later
